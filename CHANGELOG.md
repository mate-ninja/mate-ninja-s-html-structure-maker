# Change Log

# After Update [0.2.0]: mate_ninja's tweaks

## [0.2.4]

### Added 

 - PHP structure generation!
 - 2 spaces to 1 tab conversion
 - Shark based structure generation

### Changed

 - Now there is more key bindings:
   - `ctrl+alt+t` for 2 spaces to 1 tab conversion
   - `ctrl+alt+l` for listening to server for messages
   - `ctrl+alt+k` and then `ctrl+s` for sending a message to server
   - `ctrl+alt+k` and then `ctrl+g` for getting messages from server

 - This is mostly for me and my freind, but you can now put a temporary password when sending something, to not fear of our password leaking out to someone (like it even mattered)
